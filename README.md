bamazonCustomer.js is a Node application that interfaces with a mySQL database, displays information and allows the user to update the database remotely. 

Using Inquirer, the application accepts user requests regarding item type and quantity needed. After the user answers the Inquirer prompts, the specified item is removed from the bamazon storefront and the SQL database is updated accordingly. If the user requests more of an item than is available in the store, they are given a message indicating that there is not enough of the item to fulfill the request and the Inquirer process is intialized again so that the user may enter a new request.
